# Token 

This Solidity program demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language based on generating our own Token. The purpose of this program is to serve as a starting point for those who are new to Solidity and want to get a feel for how it works.

# Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solidity programming using Token which includes mapping function , mint function andd burn function, and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.

# Getting Started

## Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., Token.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.19" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile Token.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "Token" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "Token" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

After deploying contract you can choose mint function then burn function and provide some input and then check out totalsupply amount by performing different functions.
